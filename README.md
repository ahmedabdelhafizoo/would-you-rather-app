# Would you rather Project

A part of the Advanced Web Track Nanodegree.

## Project Overview
In the "Would You Rather?" Project, i built a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In this app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.


## How to run the project

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- `npm install`
to install all required packages and get node modules folder:
- `npm run start`
to run and view the project
